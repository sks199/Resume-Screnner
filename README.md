Here I have trained the dataset with two models.
1. OneVsRestClassifier with KNeighborsClassifier as the estimator
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier

It seems that MultinomialNB has achieved a higher training score than the OnevsRestClassifier and that is why i decided to save the Multinomial model and use to for writing the script
